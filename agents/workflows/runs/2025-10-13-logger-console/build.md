# Build Phase â€” Logger Console Simplification

## Changes Applied

- Removed CloudWatch-specific types from `LoggerServiceSchema`, switching to variadic `unknown` inputs and `Effect.Effect<void, never>`.
- Updated the node-server console logger implementation to forward spread arguments to `console.info`/`console.error` and drop metadata returns.
- Adjusted Vitest suites and fakes to match the simplified API, capturing raw argument arrays for assertions.

## Self-review Checklist

- [x] Only files tied to the logger schema/implementation/tests were modified.
- [x] Effect layering via `Layer.succeed(LoggerService, ...)` remains unchanged for application/security exports.
- [x] Fakes and tests now assert on `undefined` resolution and console forwarding without CloudWatch metadata.

## Follow-ups

- Run targeted logger tests during verify.
- Update Memory Bank metadata (front matter, reflexions, progress log) after verification checks pass.
