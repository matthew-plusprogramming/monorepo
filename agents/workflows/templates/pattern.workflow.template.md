Title: <Pattern Name> Workflow
---

Intent

- Encapsulate a high-importance procedural pattern discovered in `agents/memory-bank/system.patterns.md` as a reusable, diff-able workflow.

State

- current_phase: planner
- last_actor: <set by agent>
- derived_from_pattern: <PAT-YYYYMMDD-slug>

Global Prompts

- Follow the same phase structure as default; customize checklists to the patternâ€™s steps.
- Keep unrelated changes out; update Memory Bank as needed.
