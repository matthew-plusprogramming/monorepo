# Progress Log

- 2025-09-03: Bootstrapped the Memory Bank, default workflow, and ADR-0001 to codify retrieval tiers.
- 2025-09-10: Moved logger/DynamoDB tags into backend-core under ADR-0002 while preserving node-server layering.
- 2025-09-11: Hardened user repo/schema flows, enforced AppLayer provisioning, and standardized lint/Markdown workflows (ADR-0003/0004).
- 2025-09-13: Required Given/When/Then planning with explicit Non-goals via ADR-0005 and refreshed Memory Bank metadata.
- 2025-09-16: Synced agents Markdown with upstream templates and validated format/lint/memory scripts.
- 2025-09-18: Shipped node-server Vitest setup, shared config presets, testing guidelines, and the initial testing plan.
- 2025-09-20: Extended node-server coverage across services, middleware, and infra wiring while iterating plan/build/verify loops and condensing Memory Bank artifacts.
- 2025-09-21: Adopted supertest integration slices plus repo/register/schema specs to close high-risk testing gaps and update tooling.
- 2025-10-08: Added `/heartbeat`, refreshed DAU/MAU design docs, provisioned the analytics stack, and wired EventBridge analytics with supporting tests.
- 2025-10-09: Hardened heartbeat analytics (partial failures, IAM scope), refreshed app READMEs, and queued the log-condensation pass.
- 2025-10-13: Completed plan phase for console-only logger refactor and queued build/test steps.
- 2025-10-13: Executed build phase to remove CloudWatch adapters and export console-backed logger layers.
- 2025-10-13: Ran targeted logger service tests and memory validation/drift checks to close verify phase.
- 2025-10-13: Realigned CDK output consumers/tests with `myapp-*` stack keys, restoring full workspace test runs.
- 2025-10-13: Removed application/security log group outputs and CloudWatch resources after migrating to console logging.
- 2025-10-13: Planned console-pass-through logger refactor, covering schema, implementation, tests, and memory tasks.
- 2025-10-13: Executed build by refactoring logger schema/service/tests to variadic unknown args with void effects, eliminating CloudWatch metadata.
- 2025-10-13: Verified console-forwarding logger via Vitest, updated Memory Bank metadata, and validated drift/paths.
- 2025-10-14: Synced backend-server-cdk docs with stack names and outputs, and hardened consumer typing against bootstrap artifacts.
- 2025-10-15: Planned stack-name single source across CDK consumers and node-client, flagging re-export and cycle risks.
- 2025-10-15: Built shared stack-name exports, updated schemas/stacks/client/tests, and verified via targeted Vitest run.
- 2025-10-20: Planned lint remediation across node-server tests, heartbeat handler, and CDK consumers; documented acceptance criteria and invariants before refactors.
- 2025-10-20: Executed lint fixes by adding scoped `max-lines-per-function` disables, restructuring heartbeat handler/CDK lambda helpers, tightening JSON parsing, and confirming lint passes.
- 2025-10-20: Verified lint remains clean post-fixes and completed memory validation plus drift checks after stamping metadata.
