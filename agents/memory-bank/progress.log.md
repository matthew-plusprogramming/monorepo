# Progress Log

- 2025-09-03: Scaffolded Memory Bank canonical files, workflows overview, and default workflow. Updated AGENTS.md to direct usage; stamped core metadata; added Reflexion entries.
- 2025-09-03: Added ADR-0001 (Proposed) to adopt Memory Bank + Workflow Process Files.
- 2025-09-03: Folded legacy Memory Bank core/deep docs into canonical files; updated overview, scripts, and references to validate/drift against the entire Memory Bank.
- 2025-09-10: Extracted Logger/DynamoDB Effect service definitions to `packages/core/backend-core`; live Layers remain in `apps/node-server`. Added ADR-0002 (Proposed).
- 2025-09-11: Introduced `UserRepo.findByIdentifier` with centralized projection and error mapping; refactored `getUser` and `register` handlers; added default Layer hook in backend-core and applied at app bootstrap.
- 2025-09-11: Moved `UserPublic` type and projection into `@packages/schemas/user`; added `UserCreate` schema; updated repo to use `@aws-sdk/util-dynamodb` marshall/unmarshall and added `create(user)`; refactored register handler to use repo.create.
- 2025-09-11: Updated default workflow to mandate `npm run lint:fix` after tasks; executed lint:fix across workspaces.
- 2025-09-11: Removed unsafe `as unknown as` cast in `defaultLayer`; enforced default layer presence; eliminated `any` usage in `userRepo.service` with precise AWS types; returned `UserPublic` directly in `getUser` handler and cleaned imports; lint and build clean.
- 2025-09-11: Moved default Layer management to node-server; deleted backend-core `defaultLayer.ts`; `generateRequestHandler` now assumes fully-provided effects; handlers wrap with `Effect.provide(AppLayer)`; added ADR-0003 (Proposed).
- 2025-09-11: Added root script `format:markdown` using Prettier (CommonMark) to format `agents/**/*.md`; wired via prelint hooks so it runs with `lint`/`lint:fix`; updated default workflow and docs accordingly.
- 2025-09-11: Ops check after dependency updates — lint passed, Turbo builds for apps/packages passed, tests via `turbo run test` surfaced missing-task errors for workspaces without `test` scripts; recommended making root test resilient or adding no-op tests.
- 2025-09-11: Consolidated workflows to three phases (plan → build → verify); updated default workflow, pattern template, and overview; added ADR-0004.
- 2025-09-13: Required Given/When/Then acceptance criteria and Non-goals in plan; tightened gates and verify checklist; added ADR-0005; stamped Memory Bank metadata.
- 2025-09-16: Planned alignment of agents Markdown with updated template while preserving repo-specific instructions.
- 2025-09-16: Updated agents Markdown to latest template format while retaining repo-specific policies.

- 2025-09-18: Extracted Vitest config into @configs/vitest-config with node/browser helpers and updated node-server to consume shared preset.
- 2025-09-18: Planned testing-guidelines refresh to incorporate boundary policies, DI requirements, testing scopes, and supporting utilities.
- 2025-09-18: Authored testing guidelines covering boundary defaults, reusable builders/fakes, unit-type expectations, and review checklist.

- 2025-09-18: Authored node-server testing plan detailing target suites, shared fakes, and priority order.
- 2025-09-18: Verified testing plan updates with markdown formatting plus memory validation and drift checks.
- 2025-09-18: Implemented node-server testing helpers (Dynamo/Logger fakes, user builders, time & UUID utilities, Express harness) and updated tsconfig to include tests; ran Vitest, lint:fix, and memory checks.
- 2025-09-20: Planned uuid test helper typing fix to resolve node-server build errors.
- 2025-09-20: Updated uuid test helper typing and reran node-server build/test scripts to confirm errors cleared.
- 2025-09-20: Completed verification with lint:fix plus memory validation/drift to finalize uuid helper fix.
- 2025-09-20: Planned pure/validation test implementation for Environment schema, JSON error middleware, and location helpers in node-server.
- 2025-09-20: Implemented Vitest coverage for Environment schema validation, JSON error middleware, and location helper paths.
- 2025-09-20: Verified new node-server tests with Vitest, repo lint:fix, markdown formatting, and memory validation/drift after stamping current SHA.
- 2025-09-20: Planned relocation of node-server Vitest specs into `src/__tests__`, defining acceptance criteria around green test runs post-move.
- 2025-09-20: Moved helper/middleware/types/location specs under `src/__tests__`, updated imports to use aliases, and fixed location path assertions.
- 2025-09-20: Re-ran node-server Vitest and repo lint:fix after relocations; memory validation/drift remained clean.
- 2025-09-20: Planned node-server service test additions covering userRepo, dynamodb, and logger modules using fakes plus AWS client mocks.

- 2025-09-20: Hardened node-server service specs to satisfy TypeScript by tightening Layer typings, using Reflect-based env cleanup, and adjusting Dynamo command expectations; verified via build, test, and lint runs.
- 2025-09-20: Expanded node-server coverage by testing zodParser error wrapping, DynamoDb putItem success/failure, and bundled console logger fallback; verified with test/build/lint runs.
- 2025-09-20: Assessed userRepo unmarshallUser Option.none coverage, noted absence of invalid-item test case, and refreshed Memory Bank metadata.
- 2025-09-20: Planned Option.none coverage test for userRepo by targeting an invalid Dynamo item scenario.
