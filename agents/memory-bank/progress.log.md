# Progress Log

- 2025-09-03: Bootstrapped Memory Bank canonical files and default workflow, added ADR-0001, and consolidated legacy docs under the canonical structure.
- 2025-09-10: Moved logger and DynamoDB service tags into backend-core, preserved node-server layers, and opened ADR-0002.
- 2025-09-11: Expanded user repo/schema flows, enforced AppLayer provisioning while removing unsafe casts, codified `npm run lint:fix` usage, introduced Markdown formatting, consolidated workflows (ADR-0003/0004), and verified builds/tests despite missing test scripts in some workspaces.
- 2025-09-13: Tightened planning requirements with Given/When/Then acceptance criteria and explicit Non-goals, logged ADR-0005, and refreshed Memory Bank metadata.
- 2025-09-16: Planned and executed agents Markdown template sync while preserving repo-specific policies, plus format/lint/memory validations.
- 2025-09-18: Planned, built, and verified node-server Vitest setup, shared config preset, testing guidelines, testing plan, and helper fakes with full lint/format/memory passes.
- 2025-09-20: Iterated on node-server coverage—typed UUID helper fix, environment/middleware/location specs, spec relocations, service test expansion, Dynamo/logger/zod coverage, and Option.none validation—running plan/build/verify loops with lint, build, test, and memory checks after each milestone; also condensed Memory Bank reflexions/log for quicker retrieval.
- 2025-09-20: Planned upcoming middleware test coverage for auth and rate limiting, aligning acceptance criteria with testing guidelines and preparing fakes/utilities for implementation.
- 2025-09-20: Delivered auth and rate limit middleware suites using shared fakes, injected logger/dynamo layers via Vitest mocks, corrected missing Effect yields in both middlewares, and closed out lint/test passes with memory updates.
- 2025-09-20: Added node-server specs for CDK outputs, AppLayer, and the lambda entrypoint—verifying base-path toggles, layer provisioning, and serverless wiring—then refreshed the testing plan and reran lint/tests.
- 2025-09-21: Added handler tests for getUser and register per testing guidelines and the node-server testing plan; mocked AppLayer to inject a UserRepo fake, stubbed argon2/JWT/time for determinism, verified behavior against current obfuscation rules, and updated Memory Bank stamps.
- 2025-09-21: Audited node-server suites against testing guidelines, prioritizing gaps across the missing Express integration slice, `ipRateLimiting` `req.ip` branch, `UserRepo` ID success/error flows, `register` payload/JWT assertions, boot-level `index.ts` coverage, and untested core schemas; refreshed Memory Bank metadata for the review task.
