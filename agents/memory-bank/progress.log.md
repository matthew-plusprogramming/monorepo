# Progress Log

- 2025-09-03: Bootstrapped the Memory Bank, default workflow, and ADR-0001 to codify retrieval tiers.
- 2025-09-10 to 2025-09-13: Centralized logging, hardened repository flows, and mandated Given/When/Then planning via ADR-0002 through ADR-0005.
- 2025-09-16 to 2025-09-21: Synced agent docs with upstream templates, shipped Vitest tooling/testing guidelines, and expanded node-server coverage with supertest integration slices.
- 2025-10-08 to 2025-10-09: Shipped the authenticated `/heartbeat`, analytics stack wiring, hardened analytics failure handling, refreshed READMEs, and kicked off log condensation work.
- 2025-10-13: Completed console-forwarding logger refactor, removed CloudWatch resources, aligned consumers/tests, and validated Memory Bank metadata plus drift checks.
- 2025-10-14: Updated backend-server-cdk docs and outputs typing to exclude bootstrap artifacts while keeping lint clean.
- 2025-10-15: Centralized stack-name exports across CDK stacks, consumers, and node-server clients; verified with targeted Vitest suites and memory validation.
- 2025-10-20: Delivered lint remediation, repository-service workflow codification, user repository hardening, and automation for unsafe assertions plus broader code-quality checks.
- 2025-10-21: Enhanced repository-service workflow guidance, unified API security resources, rolled out AAA comment policy, and enforced it with the AST-based quality runner integration.
- 2025-10-21: Condensed Memory Bank active context and progress log summaries, refreshed metadata stamps, and reran validation/drift plus phase checks to keep context high-signal.
- 2025-10-21: Planned node-server test helper consolidation, cataloged duplicated CDK output stubs and bundling flag setup, and outlined refactor targets for shared utilities.
- 2025-10-21: Refactored node-server suites onto shared CDK output stubs and runtime helpers, ran `npm run test -w apps/node-server`, and cleared `phase:check`.
- 2025-10-21: Extracted reusable testing fakes/runtime/request context into `@packages/backend-core/testing`, trimmed the register handler spec below lint thresholds, and reran node-server tests plus `phase:check`.
- 2025-10-22: Scoped analytics stack resource/output renames, refreshed construct IDs and outputs across CDK/API consumers, and reran phase plus finalize checks to confirm lint and memory validation.
- 2025-10-21: Planned expansion of the unsafe assertion detector to cover non-null assertions and defined local validation strategy.
- 2025-10-21: Implemented the detector updates, verified CLI output, and noted `phase:check` currently fails due to existing Effect.runPromise violations in testing utilities.
- 2025-10-21: Ran memory validation, drift check, and `agent:finalize`; finalize still blocked by the same Effect.runPromise allowlist findings.
- 2025-10-21: Renamed the unsafe assertion detector to `find-unsafe-assertions.mjs`, updated orchestrators/help text, and confirmed `phase:check` still fails on pre-existing Effect.runPromise usage.
- 2025-10-21: Documented the Express testing utilities in the Effect.runPromise allowlist, updated the code-quality runner to aggregate failures, and reran `npm run phase:check` to capture the full suite output.
- 2025-10-21: Removed remaining non-null assertions via DOM guards, script stack checks, and tightened test helpers; verified with `find-unsafe-assertions` and `npm run phase:check`.
- 2025-10-22: Planned and built repository-service scaffolding automation, adding the CLI, modular bundle manifests (base + handler), workflow/README documentation, and validating with `npm run agent:finalize`.
- 2025-10-22: Logged plan for lint warning investigation covering analytics resource generation and register handler, with scope, constraints, and next analysis steps.
- 2025-10-22: Documented lint warning analysis, detailed root causes, and outlined helper-extraction remediation as the preferred follow-up.
- 2025-10-22: Planned helper-based refactors to clear the remaining `max-lines-per-function` warnings while preserving analytics resources and registration behavior.
- 2025-10-22: Extracted analytics resource builders and decomposed the register handler into Effect helpers, then reran lint and phase checks to verify the warnings cleared.
- 2025-10-22: Closed the lint remediation by running `npm run agent:finalize`, confirming memory validation/drift, and documenting verification outputs.
- 2025-10-22: Planned the CDKTF state automation CLI, capturing bootstrap toggles, command sequencing, and cleanup invariants ahead of implementation.
- 2025-10-22: Implemented the CDKTF state CLI and refreshed automation docs, setting up verification of the bootstrap workflow.
- 2025-10-22: Taught the CLI to remove `cdk/backend-server-cdk/terraform.<stack>.tfstate` in addition to the legacy `.terraform/terraform.tfstate` copy during cleanup.
- 2025-10-22: Ran `npm run phase:check` and attempted `npm run agent:finalize`; validation failed due to missing historical workflow run artifacts referenced in the Memory Bank.
- 2025-10-22: Executed Vitest v4 build workâ€”added unit/integration projects with `extends: true`, migrated env handling to `vi.stubEnv`, refactored DynamoDB mocks, and reran node-server/schemas tests.
- 2025-10-22: Verified the Vitest v4 improvements (`phase:check` green, acceptance criteria traced). `agent:finalize` still blocked by pre-existing missing workflow run artifacts referenced in `active.context.md`.
- 2025-10-22: Planned coverage fix by identifying shared Vitest config pointing coverage include to test globs; scoped update to instrument source directories and leave integration suite excluded.
