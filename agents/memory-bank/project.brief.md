# Project Brief

Scope & Goals
- Build an opinionated TypeScript monorepo providing a Node/Express service (Lambda-capable) with CDKTF infrastructure, shared schemas/utilities, and repo-native agent workflows.
- Make agent collaboration first-class via Memory Bank and Workflow Process files.

Non-Goals
- Production hardening and full test coverage at this stage.

Success Criteria
- Clear entrypoints and invariants documented under `agents/memory-bank/*`.
- Memory Bank and Workflows present, validated, and used for all changes.
