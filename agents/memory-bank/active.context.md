# Active Context

Current Focus

- Keep the Memory Bank and default workflow concise, accurate, and aligned with AGENTS.md guidance.
- Maintain high-signal reflection summaries that point to the latest workflows, scripts, and ADRs.

Next Steps

- Track upstream agent-template updates and capture repo-specific deviations through ADRs when policies diverge.
- Periodically prune reflection/log entries to preserve readability without losing key decisions.

Open Decisions

- Define the long-term ADR indexing cadence as the system matures.
