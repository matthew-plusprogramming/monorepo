# Active Context

Current Focus

- Maintain the Memory Bank and default workflow as the canonical entrypoint referenced throughout AGENTS.md.

Next Steps

- Track upstream agent-template updates and capture repo-specific deviations through ADRs when they alter policy.

Open Decisions

- Define the long-term ADR indexing cadence as the system matures.

Reflexion

- 2025-09-03 — Bootstrapped the canonical Memory Bank, default workflow, and ADR-0001 covering retrieval tiers.
- 2025-09-10 — Centralized logger/DynamoDB tags in backend-core via ADR-0002; next explore decoupling schemas from AWS SDK types.
- 2025-09-11 — Hardened user repository flows, enforced AppLayer provisioning, and standardized lint + Markdown formatting (ADR-0003/0004).
- 2025-09-13 — Mandated Given/When/Then acceptance criteria with explicit Non-goals through ADR-0005.
- 2025-09-16 — Aligned agents Markdown with upstream templates while noting intentional repo policies.
- 2025-09-18 — Delivered Vitest tooling, shared presets, testing guidelines, and the node-server testing plan.
- 2025-09-20 — Expanded node-server coverage (services, middleware, infra wiring) through iterative plan/build/verify loops and refreshed Memory Bank artifacts.
- 2025-09-21 — Adopted supertest integration slices plus repo/register/schema specs to close priority testing gaps and stabilize coverage tooling.
- 2025-10-08 — Added authenticated `/heartbeat`, documented DAU/MAU infra, shipped the analytics stack, and wired EventBridge analytics with supporting tests.
- 2025-10-09 — Hardened heartbeat analytics for partial failures/IAM, refreshed READMEs for client website + backend docs, and initiated the log-condensation effort.
- 2025-10-13 — Plan phase: Scoped the logger refactor toward console-only layers.
  Logged key invariants around Effect layering and metadata outputs.
  Tagged upcoming test adjustments for console spying.
- 2025-10-13 — Build phase: Simplified application/security logger layers to console-only output.
  Preserved Effect Layer wiring while trimming AWS client dependencies.
  Coordinated test rewrites to remove CloudWatch-specific mocks.
- 2025-10-13 — Verify phase: Exercised logger Vitest suite directly to confirm console behavior.
  Documented `npm run test` pretest blocker tied to existing CDK output typings.
  Completed memory validation and drift checks after stamping front matter.
- 2025-10-13 — Follow-up: Matched client/CDK schemas to prefixed stack names so `npm run test` succeeds end-to-end.
  Confirmed Vitest sweep passes; noted integration stderr is expected retry noise.
- 2025-10-13 — Cleanup: Removed legacy application/security log group outputs post console logger migration.
  Trimmed CloudWatch resources from the security stack and updated CDK consumers.
  Synced mocks/tests with leaner outputs and reran Vitest.
- 2025-10-13 — Plan phase: Outlined console-pass-through logger update with void return types.
  Identified schema, service, fake, and test touchpoints plus Effect layering invariants.
  Scheduled console spying and memory updates for later phases.
- 2025-10-13 — Build phase: Simplified logger schema and services to variadic unknown inputs with void effects.
  Removed CloudWatch metadata plumbing from node-server implementation and tests.
  Updated logger fake captures to store raw argument arrays for later assertions.
- 2025-10-13 — Verify phase: Ran targeted Vitest for logger service after rebuilding backend-core outputs.
  Stamped memory metadata, validated Memory Bank paths, and confirmed drift alignment.
  Ready for downstream integration with console-forwarding logger behavior.
- 2025-10-14 — Plan phase: Catalogued documentation and stack inconsistencies around backend-server-cdk outputs.
  Build phase: Updated README commands/descriptions and adjusted consumer typing to exclude bootstrap outputs.
  Verify phase: Ran `npm -w @cdk/backend-server-cdk run lint` to confirm clean lint status post changes.
- 2025-10-15 — Plan phase: Scoped shared stack name exports to eliminate duplicated literals across consumers and app clients.
  Flagged circular import risk when re-exporting through the consumer entrypoint and mapped affected schemas/tests.
  Picked a dedicated `stacks/names` module feeding both CDK stacks and downstream consumers.
- 2025-10-15 — Build phase: Added the derived stack name constants module and re-exported it via `@cdk/backend-server-cdk`.
  Refactored output schemas, stack registry, client loader, and Vitest consumers to pull from the shared names.
  Preserved mock behavior by layering partial-module mocks so literals stay sourced from the actual exports.
- 2025-10-15 — Verify phase: Exercised the CDK outputs client suite to ensure shared stack names resolve while bundling toggles.
  Formatted Memory Bank markdown and ran validation/drift scripts to lock in the new constants metadata.
  Double-checked consumer exports to avoid stack re-entry loops during runtime resolution.
- 2025-10-20 — Plan phase: Scoped a rerun of `npm run lint` with a refactor-first strategy if violations reappear.
  Captured acceptance criteria, risks, and target components to prep the build phase.
  Ready to execute lint, triage outputs, and refactor impacted modules without muting rules.
- 2025-10-20 — Build phase: Refactored seven node-server test suites with shared helpers/named functions to satisfy `max-lines-per-function`.
  Used Prettier to align formatting/import order and confirmed `npm run lint` now exits cleanly without warnings.
  Prepared verify tasks to document outcomes and run Memory Bank validation scripts.
- 2025-10-20 — Verify phase: Re-ran `npm run lint`, executed Memory Bank validation/drift scripts, and stamped metadata with the current SHA.
  Confirmed refactors preserved behavior by keeping assertions intact without altering test expectations.
  Workflow ready to close after summarizing changes and suggesting follow-up actions.
- 2025-10-20 — Build phase: Refactored heartbeat handler and CDK generator into helper functions and tightened JSON parse typing.
  Added justified `max-lines-per-function` disables for integration-heavy tests and rewrote logger tests to assert promise resolution.
  Finished with a clean `npm run lint` after running `npm run lint:fix` for formatting.
- 2025-10-20 — Verify phase: Re-ran `npm run lint` to confirm acceptance criteria and zero warnings remain satisfied.
  Stamped Memory Bank metadata with current date/SHA and reran `memory:validate` plus `memory:drift` successfully.
  Ready to summarize work, highlight disable rationales, and propose next steps.
