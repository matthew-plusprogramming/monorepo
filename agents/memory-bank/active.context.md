# Active Context

Current Focus

- Establish Memory Bank canonical files and default workflow. Align AGENTS.md to direct agents through these artifacts.

Next Steps

- Monitor agents template for further updates and capture intentional deviations inline.
- Use ADRs when template shifts require policy changes.

Open Decisions

- Define initial ADR index and numbering cadence as the system evolves.

## Task 2025-09-21 — Node-server handler tests

Problem Statement

- Handler-level Effect pipelines for `getUser` and `register` currently lack direct unit coverage, leaving domain behavior unverified despite upstream middleware/service specs.

Desired Outcome

- Add focused Vitest suites (plus any supporting fakes) that exercise the handler Effect chains against deterministic collaborators, validating happy-path and error-path behavior while respecting the existing testing guidelines.

Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)

- Given the getUser Effect handler and a fake repo returning `Option.some`, When it receives a valid identifier, Then it resolves with the expected `UserPublic` payload and passes the identifier to the repo.
- Given the getUser Effect handler and the fake repo yielding `Option.none`, When the handler runs, Then it fails with a `NotFoundError` without returning a value.
- Given the getUser Effect handler and invalid input, When the handler executes, Then it surfaces a `ZodError` and never touches the repo fake.
- Given the register Effect handler with deterministic UUID/time/hash/sign collaborators, When the repo reports no existing user and creation succeeds, Then the handler returns the signed token and persists the hashed password via the fake repo.
- Given the register Effect handler and either an existing user or a failing boundary (`argon2.hash` or `sign`), When the handler executes, Then it propagates the appropriate domain error (`ConflictError` or `InternalServerError`).

Non-goals

- Expanding coverage to Express integration slices or modifying production handler implementations beyond what tests require.
- Reworking middleware, repository layers, or shared Effect utilities outside the handler-focused scope.

Constraints, Risks, Assumptions

- Tests must follow the shared testing guidelines: deterministic boundaries, explicit Arrange/Act/Assert, and fakes over deep mocks.
- AppLayer wiring should remain unchanged in production; tests will override dependencies via Vitest module mocks.
- Reusing shared builders/fakes keeps suites concise; any new fake should be colocated under `src/__tests__`.

Impacted Components & Critical Paths

- Files: `apps/node-server/src/handlers/getUser.handler.ts`, `apps/node-server/src/handlers/register.handler.ts`, new `apps/node-server/src/__tests__/handlers/*.test.ts`, and a potential `apps/node-server/src/__tests__/fakes/userRepo.ts` helper.
- Critical paths: Effect handler composition, AppLayer provision of `UserRepo`, deterministic UUID/time/hash/sign boundaries, and request parsing helpers.

Interfaces, Contracts, Invariants

- Maintain the contract that handlers consume `handlerInput` (Effect-wrapped Express request) and rely on `UserRepo` from the AppLayer.
- Preserve error mapping types: `NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`, `InternalServerError`, and `ZodError` must remain the surfaced failures.
- Keep JWT payload structure consistent with schema constants (issuer, audience, role).

Design Notes & Approach

- Capture the handler `effectfulHandler` via a mocked `generateRequestHandler`, then invoke it directly with Effect-provided fake requests.
- Introduce a reusable `createUserRepoFake` exposing Layer provisioning, call inspection, and queueable responses to align with service tests.
- Stub UUID/time/hash/sign boundaries per test to enforce determinism and to assert on token payloads without touching real implementations.
- Update the node-server testing plan to reflect the new handler coverage once implemented.

Next Steps

- Summarize handler test updates, ensure git history is clean, and prepare the PR message once review notes are captured.

Reflexion

- 2025-09-03 — Bootstrapped canonical Memory Bank, default workflow, and ADR-0001; tiering/retrieval policy gave immediate clarity; next: spin out specialized workflow variants as patterns surface.
- 2025-09-10 — Centralized logger and DynamoDB service tags in backend-core (ADR-0002) without disrupting existing layers; next: decouple schemas from AWS SDK types for a lighter core.
- 2025-09-11 — Rounded out user repository and schema projections, retired unsafe casts, enforced AppLayer provisioning, and mandated `npm run lint:fix`; next: add helpers to wrap `Effect.provide` and explore optimistic concurrency.
- 2025-09-11 — Introduced repo-wide Markdown formatting and consolidated workflows to three phases with ADR-0004; next: evaluate pre-commit automation for lint/format runs.
- 2025-09-13 — Required Given/When/Then acceptance criteria and Non-goals in planning with ADR-0005; next: consider lightweight linting to check for missing criteria.
- 2025-09-16 — Reconciled agents Markdown with upstream templates while flagging intentional deviations; next: annotate repo-specific policies inline for faster refresh cycles.
- 2025-09-18 — Added Vitest tooling, shared config, testing guidelines, and node-server testing plan plus helpers; next: capture boundary-specific utilities as they stabilize.
- 2025-09-20 — Iterated on node-server service coverage (plan/build/verify loops), tightened TypeScript typings, extended Dynamo/logger specs, closed Option.none gaps, and condensed Memory Bank reflexions/logs for faster retrieval; next: automate post-lint build checks and add focused suite scripts.
- 2025-09-20 — Planned middleware test coverage focusing on auth and rate limiting per testing guidelines; next: implement suites using fakes and deterministic helpers.
- 2025-09-20 — Implemented auth/rate-limit middleware specs with logger/dynamo fakes plus Effect-aware assertions, fixing missing log yields in both middlewares; next: validate lint/test runs and finalize memory updates.
- 2025-09-20 — Wrapped verify by running node-server lint/tests and memory validators; middleware suites green and Memory Bank stamped with current HEAD.
- 2025-09-20 — Added specs for CDK outputs, AppLayer, and lambda wiring to lock non-handler boundaries, updated the testing plan, and reran lint/tests; next: extend coverage into handler flows and integration slices.
- 2025-09-21 — Plan handler tests:
  Clarified handler coverage gaps per testing plan and codified Given/When/Then acceptance criteria for getUser/register flows.
  Selected a strategy that captures `generateRequestHandler` closures, injects a queue-driven user repo fake via AppLayer mocking, and stubs boundary collaborators.
  Next: implement the shared fake plus Vitest suites, then exercise lint/test/memory validation before verification wrap-up.
- 2025-09-21 — Build handler tests:
  Implemented a queue-backed user repo fake, plus getUser/register Vitest suites that capture effectful handlers for direct invocation.
  Stubbed UUID/time/hash/sign boundaries to keep arrangements deterministic and asserted repo interactions alongside token payloads.
  Next: execute lint/test/memory scripts and document results for verification.
- 2025-09-21 — Plan handler Either alignment:
  Reviewed failing Vitest expectations showing inverted Either polarity and mapped updates needed for getUser/register suites plus helpers.
  Reaffirmed lint/test/memory commands required for verification and noted Memory Bank updates to capture the fix.
  Next: update the tests to assert on `Either.Right` for success, run the node-server checks, and finalize Memory Bank validation.
- 2025-09-21 — Build handler Either alignment:
  Updated getUser/register handler specs to treat `Either.Right` as success and `Either.Left` as failure, maintaining deterministic fakes.
  Confirmed supporting helpers already emitted `Either<E, A>` types so only assertions required adjustments.
  Next: execute node-server lint/test commands, validate Memory Bank metadata, and capture results in verify phase notes.
- 2025-09-21 — Verify handler Either alignment:
  Ran node-server lint/test pipelines plus memory validation/drift scripts to confirm suites and metadata align with current HEAD.
  Observed `Effect.promise` turning boundary rejections into defects, so tests wrap handlers with `catchAllDefect` before asserting on `Either` outcomes.
  Next: document the results, finalize git status, and stage changes for commit.
