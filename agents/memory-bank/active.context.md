# Active Context

Current Focus

- Keep the Memory Bank and default workflow concise, accurate, and aligned with AGENTS.md guidance.
- Maintain high-signal reflexion summaries that point to the latest workflows, scripts, and ADRs.

Next Steps

- Track upstream agent-template updates and capture repo-specific deviations through ADRs when policies diverge.
- Periodically prune reflexion/log entries to preserve readability without losing key decisions.

Open Decisions

- Define the long-term ADR indexing cadence as the system matures.

Reflexion

- 2025-09-03 — Bootstrapped the Memory Bank, default workflow, and ADR-0001 to anchor retrieval tiers.
  2025-09-10 to 2025-09-13 — Hardened logging, repositories, and planning discipline via ADR-0002 through ADR-0005.
  2025-09-16 to 2025-09-21 — Synced agent docs, shipped Vitest tooling/testing guidelines, and closed high-risk API coverage gaps.
- 2025-10-08 — Delivered the authenticated `/heartbeat`, analytics stack wiring, and supporting documentation/tests.
  2025-10-09 — Hardened analytics error handling, refreshed backend/client READMEs, and initiated log-condensation planning.
  2025-10-12 — Captured follow-up tasks to streamline logging and queue subsequent refactors.
- 2025-10-13 — Planned, implemented, and verified the console-forwarding logger refactor removing CloudWatch dependencies.
  Tightened Effect layer wiring, refreshed tests/mocks, and aligned schemas/consumers with console-focused metadata.
  Validated Memory Bank metadata and drift checks while documenting console logging follow-ups.
- 2025-10-14 — Reconciled backend-server-cdk docs and consumers with stack outputs to prevent bootstrap artifacts.
  Confirmed lint cleanliness, noted stack consolidation opportunities, and kept memory assets formatted.
  Ensured validation scripts stayed green after doc and typing updates.
- 2025-10-15 — Centralized stack-name exports across CDK stacks, consumers, and node-server clients.
  Updated tests, mocks, and output schemas while guarding against circular imports.
  Ran targeted Vitest suites and refreshed Memory Bank formatting plus drift checks.
- 2025-10-20 — Executed lint/test remediations, repository-service workflow codification, and user repository hardening.
  Built unsafe assertion and code-quality automation scripts with aggregate runners for continuous enforcement.
  Repeatedly stamped metadata, ran lint/tests, and confirmed memory validation/drift after each initiative.
- 2025-10-21 — Enhanced repository-service workflow guidance, consolidated API security resources, and enforced AAA comments repo-wide.
  Implemented the AST-based AAA enforcement script, integrated it into `phase:check`, and kept queue helper guidance aligned.
  Ran agent finalize flows to confirm lint, quality, and memory validation stayed green across all updates.
- 2025-10-21 — Plan phase: Scoped Memory Bank pruning to keep high-signal context while preserving durable references.
  Build phase: Condensed `active.context.md` and `progress.log.md`, updated metadata, and ran `npm run phase:check`.
  Verify phase: Executed memory validation/drift, ran `npm run agent:finalize`, and logged condensed outcomes for future hygiene passes.
- 2025-10-21 — Plan phase: Scoped shared testing package extraction and register handler test cleanup to address lint and duplication.
  Build phase: Introduced `@packages/backend-core/testing` (service fakes, request context, runtime helpers), updated node-server suites to consume it, removed local duplicates, split register helpers into a shared module, and built the package.
  Verify phase: Ran `npm run test -w apps/node-server` and `npm run phase:check` to confirm tests, lint, and automation stayed green.
- 2025-10-22 — Plan phase: Scoped analytics stack resource/output renames to improve clarity across CDK consumers.
  Build phase: Renamed analytics/API construct identifiers and outputs, aligning consumer schemas/tests with the new descriptive keys.
  Verify phase: Ran `npm run phase:check` and `npm run agent:finalize` to ensure lint, quality, and memory validation stayed green.
- 2025-10-21 — Plan phase: Scoped script updates to flag non-null assertions alongside unsafe `as` casts and settled testing approach.
  Build phase: Implemented the broader detector, updated messaging, and ran the script plus `npm run phase:check` (blocked by existing Effect.runPromise findings).
  Verify phase: Ran memory validation/drift and attempted `agent:finalize`, which still fails on the pre-existing Effect.runPromise allowlist gap.
- 2025-10-21 — Plan phase: Chose `find-unsafe-assertions.mjs` to reflect the detector’s broader scope and mapped dependent references.
  Build phase: Renamed the script, refreshed CLI help text, updated `check-code-quality` orchestration, and reran the detector manually.
  Verify phase: Re-executed `npm run phase:check`; it continues to fail on the standing `Effect.runPromise` allowlist violations.
- 2025-10-21 — Plan phase: Scoped allowlisting for the Express testing utilities and an aggregator tweak so all quality scripts run before exiting.
  Build phase: Documented the express utilities in the Effect.runPromise allowlist, taught `check-code-quality` to collect failures instead of short-circuiting, and reran `npm run phase:check`.
  Verify phase: Observed the full quality suite output, confirmed `find-unsafe-assertions` still reports sites, and validated the allowlist resolved the prior failure.
- 2025-10-21 — Plan phase: Targeted the remaining non-null assertions surfaced by the detector for safer guards/refactors.
  Build phase: Added DOM lookup validation in `client-website`, replaced stack pops with defensive checks in CDK/node-server scripts, and tightened the register handler spec around mock initialization.
  Verify phase: Reran `find-unsafe-assertions`, `npm run phase:check`, and confirmed the suite now reports zero unsafe assertions.
- 2025-10-22 — Plan phase: Scoped an automation script and templates to accelerate the repository-service workflow without touching live layers yet.
  Build phase: Implemented the CLI, modular template bundles (base + optional handler bundle), refreshed workflow and README guidance, and ran `npm run phase:check`.
  Verify phase: Executed `npm run agent:finalize`, confirmed memory validation/drift, and documented follow-up guidance in the checklist plus automation docs.
- 2025-10-22 — Plan phase: Confirmed `max-lines-per-function` lint warnings in analytics resource generation and register handler.
  Documented problem statement, acceptance criteria, and options in `agents/workflows/runs/2025-10-22-lint-investigation/plan.md`.
  Next: analyze each warning and capture remediation recommendations before proposing any code changes.
- 2025-10-22 — Build phase: Captured root-cause notes and remediation paths for both lint warnings in `agents/workflows/runs/2025-10-22-lint-investigation/build.md`.
  Highlighted helper extraction as the preferred solution, with config tweaks or suppressions as lower-priority alternatives.
  Ready to proceed to verify phase once findings are reviewed and Memory Bank updates are validated.
- 2025-10-22 — Verify phase: Ran `npm run agent:finalize`, confirmed memory validation/drift, and reran `phase:check` to keep lint output current.
  Logged verification summary in `agents/workflows/runs/2025-10-22-lint-investigation/verify.md` to close the investigation loop.
  Awaiting maintainer decision on implementation path (helper refactors vs. lint rule adjustment).
- 2025-10-22 — Plan phase: Scoped helper-extraction refactors to resolve `max-lines-per-function` warnings without changing behavior.
  Documented acceptance criteria in `agents/workflows/runs/2025-10-22-lint-remediation/plan.md` covering analytics resources and the register handler.
  Next: implement helper functions, rerun lint, and confirm warnings clear.
- 2025-10-22 — Build phase: Extracted analytics resource helper factories and decomposed the register handler into Effect helpers to shrink both functions.
  Recorded the changes in `agents/workflows/runs/2025-10-22-lint-remediation/build.md`, ensuring construct identifiers and JWT payloads remain unchanged.
  Ran `npm run lint` and `npm run phase:check` to confirm the warnings cleared and quality scripts stayed green.
- 2025-10-22 — Verify phase: Executed `npm run agent:finalize` to validate memory links, drift, and rerun quality automation for the refactor.
  Summarized verification steps in `agents/workflows/runs/2025-10-22-lint-remediation/verify.md` after confirming lint stays clean.
  Ready for review with helper-based refactors keeping behavior intact.
- 2025-10-22 — Plan phase: Scoped a CDKTF state management CLI to script the bootstrap toggle/deploy/migrate flow.
  Documented constraints, invariants, and stack-name derivation in `agents/workflows/runs/2025-10-22-cdktf-state-cli/plan.md`.
  Next: implement the CLI, update automation docs, and prepare self-checks.
- 2025-10-22 — Build phase: Implemented `scripts/manage-cdktf-state.mjs` to automate the bootstrap deploy/synth/migrate sequence and refreshed `scripts/README.md`.
  Verified CLI scaffolding with `node scripts/manage-cdktf-state.mjs --help` ahead of running quality automation.
  Updated cleanup to delete `cdk/backend-server-cdk/terraform.<stack>.tfstate` alongside the legacy `.terraform/terraform.tfstate`.
  Next: run verification scripts, restore documentation stamps, and capture the finalize summary.
- 2025-10-22 — Verify phase: Ran `npm run phase:check` successfully, then attempted `npm run agent:finalize`, which failed because referenced workflow run docs are absent.
  Documented the gap so maintainers can restore the missing run artifacts or adjust references before finalize passes.
  Next: summarize findings and highlight the outstanding memory validation issue in review notes.
