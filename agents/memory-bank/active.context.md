# Active Context

Current Focus
- Establish Memory Bank canonical files and default workflow. Align AGENTS.md to direct agents through these artifacts.

Next Steps
- Use `agents/workflows/default.workflow.md` for future tasks.
- Record ADRs when changes impact architecture or policy.

Open Decisions
- Define initial ADR index and numbering cadence as the system evolves.

Reflexion
- What happened: Introduced canonical Memory Bank files and default workflow structure; opened ADR-0001 (Proposed) to adopt them.
- What worked: Clear tiering, retrieval policy, and phase gates make orchestration transparent.
- Next time: Expand process templates as patterns emerge (e.g., bug/feature variants).
\n+- What happened (2025-09-10): Extracted Logger/DynamoDB service definitions to backend-core; left live implementations in node-server for reuse across projects.
- What worked: Centralized Effect service tags without disrupting existing app layers; minimal import churn by re-exporting tags from node-server.
- Next time: Consider decoupling service schemas from AWS SDK types to keep core lightweight.
