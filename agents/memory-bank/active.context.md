# Active Context

Current Focus

- Establish Memory Bank canonical files and default workflow. Align AGENTS.md to direct agents through these artifacts.

Next Steps

- Use `agents/workflows/default.workflow.md` for future tasks.
- Record ADRs when changes impact architecture or policy.

Open Decisions

- Define initial ADR index and numbering cadence as the system evolves.

Reflexion

- What happened: Introduced canonical Memory Bank files and default workflow structure; opened ADR-0001 (Proposed) to adopt them.
- What worked: Clear tiering, retrieval policy, and phase gates make orchestration transparent.
- Next time: Expand process templates as patterns emerge (e.g., bug/feature variants).
- What happened (2025-09-10): Extracted Logger/DynamoDB service definitions to backend-core; left live implementations in node-server for reuse across projects.
- What worked: Centralized Effect service tags without disrupting existing app layers; minimal import churn by re-exporting tags from node-server.
- Next time: Consider decoupling service schemas from AWS SDK types to keep core lightweight.
- What happened (2025-09-11): Added UserRepo with findByIdentifier, centralized projection/marshalling and error mapping.
- What worked: Handlers became thin; default Layer applied at bootstrap via backend-core hook.
- Next time: Consider adding create/update methods to UserRepo to remove remaining Dynamo glue from register flow.
- What happened (2025-09-11, later): Promoted `UserPublic` and projection to schemas; added `UserCreate`; repo uses AWS util-dynamodb for marshalling; register now calls `repo.create`.
- What worked: Reduced duplication and made DynamoDB access paths consistent.
- Next time: Consider adding optimistic concurrency (conditional writes) and created/updated timestamps in schema.
- What happened (2025-09-11, policy): Updated default.workflow to always run `npm run lint:fix` after tasks and executed it.
- What worked: Keeps style consistent and avoids noisy diffs later.
- Next time: Consider pre-commit hooks to enforce this automatically.
- What happened (2025-09-11, types): Cleaned up unsafe casts â€” removed `as unknown as` in `defaultLayer`, replaced `any` with AWS `AttributeValue` in `userRepo.service`, and returned `UserPublic` directly in `getUser`.
- What worked: Stronger types eliminated noisy casts; handlers/readers stayed simple; lint/build green.
- Next time: Tighten `generateRequestHandler` generics to align with `Effect.Effect<A, E, R>` order and remove any residual type looseness.
- What happened (2025-09-11, refactor): Moved default Layer handling from backend-core to node-server; deleted `defaultLayer.ts`; `generateRequestHandler` now expects fully-provided effects with no env deps.
- What worked: Clearer ownership boundary; handlers now explicitly `Effect.provide(AppLayer)`; build stayed green.
- Next time: Add a local helper in node-server to DRY the `provide(AppLayer)` wrapping for handlers and middleware.
- What happened (2025-09-11, docs/ops): Introduced `format:markdown` (Prettier) for `agents/**/*.md` and hooked it to run with lint tasks; updated workflow/docs.
- What worked: Markdown stays consistently formatted to CommonMark with minimal overhead.
- Next time: Consider adding a pre-commit hook to run `format:markdown` on changed `.md` files.
- What happened (2025-09-11, ops): Post-dependency update verification: ran lint (green), full builds via Turbo (green), and attempted tests. `turbo run test` failed due to missing test scripts in some workspaces.
- What worked: Build pipeline validated SSR/client apps and packages; environment injection and postbuild steps executed successfully.
- Next time: Make root `test` resilient (e.g., use `npm -ws run test --if-present`) or add no-op `test` scripts to all workspaces to avoid Turbo missing-task errors.
