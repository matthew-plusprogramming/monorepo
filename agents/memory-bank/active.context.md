# Active Context

Current Focus

- Keep the Memory Bank and default workflow concise, accurate, and aligned with AGENTS.md guidance.
- Maintain high-signal reflection summaries that point to the latest workflows, scripts, and ADRs.

Next Steps

- Track upstream agent-template updates and capture repo-specific deviations through ADRs when policies diverge.
- Periodically prune reflection/log entries to preserve readability without losing key decisions.

Open Decisions

- Define the long-term ADR indexing cadence as the system matures.

Reflection

- 2025-10-25 — Plan phase: Scoped doc + script updates to enforce one-pass context and default line-numbered outputs
  Build phase: Updated AGENTS/workflows/memory policy plus load-context/read-files/smart-file-query to emit numbered text with optional --json fallback
  Verify phase: Ran npm run phase:check, git-diff-with-lines, and spot-checked new script modes to confirm line numbers without regressing JSON consumers
- 2025-10-26 — Plan phase: Scoping doc + workflow updates to improve list-files-recursively UX and consolidate retrieval guidance into memory-bank canonical reference.
- 2025-10-26 — Build phase: Updated list-files-recursively CLI to allow default match-all pattern, refreshed AGENTS/tools docs with concrete usage, and retargeted workflows to cite the memory-bank retrieval policy.
- 2025-10-26 — Verify phase: Re-ran npm run phase:check plus git-diff-with-lines after doc/workflow updates and confirmed retrieval guidance now points to the canonical memory-bank policy.
- 2025-10-27 — Plan phase: Planned DEBUG-gated log channel covering service schema, app layer, and testing surfaces.
  Build phase: Implemented logDebug across backend-core + console layer, added DEBUG env schema, rebuilt package.
  Verify phase: Extended logger service tests for DEBUG enabled/disabled and reran npm run phase:check.
- 2025-10-29 — Plan phase: Scoped lambda artifact manifest + skip strategy to avoid dist collisions during synth
  Build phase: Added shared lambda artifact definitions, rewrote copy script with per-stack staging/manifest, and wired stacks to new asset paths with synth skip guard
  Verify phase: npm run phase:check and git-diff-with-lines.mjs to confirm lint/tests clean and new logic gated missing artifacts
- 2025-10-29 — Plan phase: Scoped stack typing fix to restore optional property access in CDK entrypoint.
  Build phase: Widened stack definitions via AnyStack export and updated index consumers; phase:check passed.
  Verify phase: Diff captured; agent:finalize fails on pre-existing memory validation referencing system.patterns.md.
- 2025-10-29 — Plan phase: Plan: Reviewed consumers typing mismatch and defined acceptance tests including phase:check and build.
- 2025-10-29 — Plan phase: Scoped removal of 'as unknown as' cast in stack output consumer
  Build phase: Simplified stack output typing via helper guard, dropped the double cast, and revalidated with npm run phase:check plus npm run build.
  Verify phase: Captured git-diff-with-lines; npm run agent:finalize remains blocked by existing system.patterns.md validation error.
- 2025-10-29 — Plan phase: Scoped repo-wide TS quality heuristics change to scan tracked+untracked sources while preserving allowlists.
- 2025-10-29 — Build phase: Expanded git file enumeration to include unstaged TS sources and revalidated via npm run phase:check.
- 2025-10-30 — Verify phase: Replayed git-diff-with-lines, smoke-tested untracked Effect.promise detection, agent:finalize still blocked by pre-existing system.patterns.md reference.
- 2025-10-30 — Plan phase: Planned ip middleware refactor to isolate rate limit selection logic.
  Build phase: Extracted Effect-based rate limit window update into enforceRateLimitForIp helper.
  Verify phase: Ran npm run phase:check; existing coverage sufficient for refactor.
- 2025-10-31 — Plan phase: Scoped hook lifecycle + config-driven scaffold plan.
  Build phase: Pending
  Verify phase: Pending
- 2025-10-31 — Plan phase: Scoped hook lifecycle + config-driven scaffold plan.
  Build phase: Extracted scaffold utilities + hook registry; repository-service now config-driven.
  Verify phase: Pending
- 2025-10-31 — Plan phase: Scoped hook lifecycle + config-driven scaffold plan.
  Build phase: Extracted scaffold utilities + hook registry; repository-service now config-driven.
  Verify phase: Ran node --test on scripts/utils, npm run phase:check, and git-diff-with-lines.mjs to confirm hook/config rollout.
