# Active Context

Current Focus

- Maintain the Memory Bank and default workflow as the canonical entrypoint referenced throughout AGENTS.md.

Next Steps

- Track upstream agent-template updates and capture repo-specific deviations through ADRs when they alter policy.

Open Decisions

- Define the long-term ADR indexing cadence as the system matures.

## 2025-10-20 — Code Quality Automation Scripts

Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)

- Given the previously identified hygiene checks, when we complete this task, then each check ships as a standalone Node script under `agents/scripts/` with discoverable help output and a non-zero exit code on violations.
- Given the individual scripts exist, when the aggregate “check code quality” utility runs, then it executes every check (including `agents/scripts/find-unsafe-as-casts.mjs`) and fails if any constituent script fails.
- Given contributors run the scripts from the repo root, when scans finish, then they operate on git-tracked sources only and emit actionable file:line diagnostics without mutating files.

Non-goals

- Modifying ESLint/Prettier configuration or auto-fixing violations.
- Scanning non-tracked or generated artifacts (e.g., `dist/`, build outputs).

Constraints & Assumptions

- Scripts target git-tracked files enumerated via `git ls-files`.
- Prefer lightweight parsing (string/JSON schemas) unless an AST is required for accuracy.
- Provide ignores/allowlists for sanctioned locations (e.g., tests needing console access).

Risks & Mitigations

- False positives in tests → scope scripts to production paths or expose `--include-tests` flag.
- Runtime cost in CI → share helper utilities to avoid repeated work (e.g., cached env schema).
- Aggregated failures obscuring root cause → aggregate runner surfaces per-script output and stops on first failure while printing a summary.

Candidate Files & Tests

- `agents/scripts/*.mjs` (new check scripts plus aggregate runner).
- Production code under `apps/node-server/src/**`, `packages/core/**`, `cdk/backend-server-cdk/src/**`.
- Existing tests for verifying allowlists (`apps/node-server/src/__tests__/**`) where necessary.

Testing Strategy

- Run each script locally on the clean tree to confirm zero findings and success messaging.
- During development, temporarily inject known violations to exercise failure paths, then remove.
- Execute the aggregate script to ensure it correctly chains existing and new checks.

Next Steps

- Inventory heuristics per script and define allowlists/outputs.
- Implement scripts with shared helper utilities where appropriate.
- Combine scripts into a master runner and document usage.

## 2025-10-20 — User Repository Service Implementation

Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)

- Given a stored user accessible by email, when `findByIdentifier` receives that email, then it returns `Option.some` with a `UserPublic` parsed via the email GSI.
- Given an existing user id, when `findByIdentifier` receives the id, then it validates the identifier, fetches via the primary key, and returns `Option.some` with a `UserPublic`.
- Given a valid `UserCreate` payload, when `create` runs, then it validates the payload, writes to DynamoDB using schema constants and CDK outputs, and returns `true`.
- Given an invalid payload or DynamoDB failure, when repository methods run, then they log the underlying issue and fail with `InternalServerError`.

Non-goals

- Adding update/delete flows, GSIs, or backfill scripts.
- Modifying user schema shapes beyond validation needed for repository use.

Constraints & Assumptions

- Table names and keys come from `@/clients/cdkOutputs` and `USER_SCHEMA_CONSTANTS`; no literals.
- Repositories expose Effect layers via `Context.Tag` with explicit `InternalServerError` typing.
- Inputs are validated with Zod before DynamoDB writes; outputs pass through `UserPublicSchema`.

Risks & Mitigations

- DynamoDB marshalling bugs → reuse schema constants and extend unit coverage for query/put payloads.
- Validation gaps → add explicit Zod parsing and tests for invalid payloads.
- Handler regressions → ensure repository contract shape remains unchanged for existing handlers.

Candidate Files & Tests

- `apps/node-server/src/services/userRepo.service.ts`
- `apps/node-server/src/__tests__/services/userRepo.service.test.ts`
- `apps/node-server/src/__tests__/fakes/userRepo.ts`
- `apps/node-server/src/__tests__/builders/user.ts`

Testing Strategy

- Extend repository unit tests for validation, DynamoDB failure logging, and identifier filtering.
- Re-run `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm -w @cdk/backend-server-cdk run lint`.

Next Steps

- Summarize repository service updates, stamp Memory Bank metadata, and prepare final handoff guidance.

## 2025-10-20 — Unsafe Type Assertion Audit Script

Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)

- Given the script runs from the repo root, when it encounters `as any`, `as never`, or double assertions like `as unknown as SomeType` in tracked TypeScript sources, then it prints the file path and 1-based line number for each occurrence.
- Given a matching assertion preceded by contiguous `//` or `/* ... */` comments with no intervening code, when the script reports it, then it emits that comment block above the flagged line.
- Given a run with no unsafe assertions, when the scan completes, then the script exits 0 and prints a short confirmation message.

Non-goals

- Automatically fixing or rewriting the unsafe assertions.
- Scanning non-TypeScript files or generated artifacts.

Constraints & Assumptions

- Use the TypeScript compiler API to parse files so nested assertions and comment adjacency are detected accurately.
- Limit the scan to git-tracked TypeScript sources (excluding `.d.ts`) discovered via `git ls-files`.
- Treat only `as any`, `as never`, and double assertions through `unknown` as unsafe by default while keeping the list extensible.

Risks & Mitigations

- Large repos could make parsing slow → iterate over git-tracked files and short-circuit with actionable errors if a file fails to parse.
- False positives from comment literals → rely on AST traversal instead of regex scanning.

Candidate Files & Tests

- `agents/scripts/find-unsafe-as-casts.mjs`
- Manual verification via `node agents/scripts/find-unsafe-as-casts.mjs`

Testing Strategy

- Execute the script against the repo to confirm expected matches print with associated comments and the no-match path works.
