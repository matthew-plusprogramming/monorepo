# Active Context

Current Focus

- Maintain the Memory Bank and default workflow as the canonical entrypoint referenced throughout AGENTS.md.

Next Steps

- Track upstream agent-template updates and capture repo-specific deviations through ADRs when they alter policy.

Open Decisions

- Define the long-term ADR indexing cadence as the system matures.
