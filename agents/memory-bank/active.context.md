# Active Context

Current Focus

- Maintain the Memory Bank and default workflow as the canonical entrypoint referenced throughout AGENTS.md.

Next Steps

- Track upstream agent-template updates and capture repo-specific deviations through ADRs when they alter policy.

Open Decisions

- Define the long-term ADR indexing cadence as the system matures.

Reflexion

- 2025-09-03 — Bootstrapped the canonical Memory Bank, default workflow, and ADR-0001 covering retrieval tiers.
- 2025-09-10 — Centralized logger/DynamoDB tags in backend-core via ADR-0002; next explore decoupling schemas from AWS SDK types.
- 2025-09-11 — Hardened user repository flows, enforced AppLayer provisioning, and standardized lint + Markdown formatting (ADR-0003/0004).
- 2025-09-13 — Mandated Given/When/Then acceptance criteria with explicit Non-goals through ADR-0005.
- 2025-09-16 — Aligned agents Markdown with upstream templates while noting intentional repo policies.
- 2025-09-18 — Delivered Vitest tooling, shared presets, testing guidelines, and the node-server testing plan.
- 2025-09-20 — Expanded node-server coverage (services, middleware, infra wiring) through iterative plan/build/verify loops and refreshed Memory Bank artifacts.
- 2025-09-21 — Adopted supertest integration slices plus repo/register/schema specs to close priority testing gaps and stabilize coverage tooling.
- 2025-10-08 — Added authenticated `/heartbeat`, documented DAU/MAU infra, shipped the analytics stack, and wired EventBridge analytics with supporting tests.
- 2025-10-09 — Hardened heartbeat analytics for partial failures/IAM, refreshed READMEs for client website + backend docs, and initiated the log-condensation effort.
- 2025-10-13 — Plan phase: Scoped the logger refactor toward console-only layers.
  Logged key invariants around Effect layering and metadata outputs.
  Tagged upcoming test adjustments for console spying.
- 2025-10-13 — Build phase: Simplified application/security logger layers to console-only output.
  Preserved Effect Layer wiring while trimming AWS client dependencies.
  Coordinated test rewrites to remove CloudWatch-specific mocks.
- 2025-10-13 — Verify phase: Exercised logger Vitest suite directly to confirm console behavior.
  Documented `npm run test` pretest blocker tied to existing CDK output typings.
  Completed memory validation and drift checks after stamping front matter.
- 2025-10-13 — Follow-up: Matched client/CDK schemas to prefixed stack names so `npm run test` succeeds end-to-end.
  Confirmed Vitest sweep passes; noted integration stderr is expected retry noise.
- 2025-10-13 — Cleanup: Removed legacy application/security log group outputs post console logger migration.
  Trimmed CloudWatch resources from the security stack and updated CDK consumers.
  Synced mocks/tests with leaner outputs and reran Vitest.
- 2025-10-13 — Plan phase: Outlined console-pass-through logger update with void return types.
  Identified schema, service, fake, and test touchpoints plus Effect layering invariants.
  Scheduled console spying and memory updates for later phases.
- 2025-10-13 — Build phase: Simplified logger schema and services to variadic unknown inputs with void effects.
  Removed CloudWatch metadata plumbing from node-server implementation and tests.
  Updated logger fake captures to store raw argument arrays for later assertions.
- 2025-10-13 — Verify phase: Ran targeted Vitest for logger service after rebuilding backend-core outputs.
  Stamped memory metadata, validated Memory Bank paths, and confirmed drift alignment.
  Ready for downstream integration with console-forwarding logger behavior.
- 2025-10-14 — Plan phase: Catalogued documentation and stack inconsistencies around backend-server-cdk outputs.
  Build phase: Updated README commands/descriptions and adjusted consumer typing to exclude bootstrap outputs.
  Verify phase: Ran `npm -w @cdk/backend-server-cdk run lint` to confirm clean lint status post changes.
- 2025-10-15 — Plan phase: Scoped shared stack name exports to eliminate duplicated literals across consumers and app clients.
  Flagged circular import risk when re-exporting through the consumer entrypoint and mapped affected schemas/tests.
  Picked a dedicated `stacks/names` module feeding both CDK stacks and downstream consumers.
- 2025-10-15 — Build phase: Added the derived stack name constants module and re-exported it via `@cdk/backend-server-cdk`.
  Refactored output schemas, stack registry, client loader, and Vitest consumers to pull from the shared names.
  Preserved mock behavior by layering partial-module mocks so literals stay sourced from the actual exports.
- 2025-10-15 — Verify phase: Exercised the CDK outputs client suite to ensure shared stack names resolve while bundling toggles.
  Formatted Memory Bank markdown and ran validation/drift scripts to lock in the new constants metadata.
  Double-checked consumer exports to avoid stack re-entry loops during runtime resolution.
