# Active Context

Current Focus

- Keep the Memory Bank and default workflow concise, accurate, and aligned with AGENTS.md guidance.
- Maintain high-signal reflexion summaries that point to the latest workflows, scripts, and ADRs.

Next Steps

- Track upstream agent-template updates and capture repo-specific deviations through ADRs when policies diverge.
- Periodically prune reflexion/log entries to preserve readability without losing key decisions.

Open Decisions

- Define the long-term ADR indexing cadence as the system matures.

Reflexion

- 2025-09-03 — Bootstrapped the Memory Bank, default workflow, and ADR-0001 to anchor retrieval tiers.
  2025-09-10 to 2025-09-13 — Hardened logging, repositories, and planning discipline via ADR-0002 through ADR-0005.
  2025-09-16 to 2025-09-21 — Synced agent docs, shipped Vitest tooling/testing guidelines, and closed high-risk API coverage gaps.
- 2025-10-08 — Delivered the authenticated `/heartbeat`, analytics stack wiring, and supporting documentation/tests.
  2025-10-09 — Hardened analytics error handling, refreshed backend/client READMEs, and initiated log-condensation planning.
  2025-10-12 — Captured follow-up tasks to streamline logging and queue subsequent refactors.
- 2025-10-13 — Planned, implemented, and verified the console-forwarding logger refactor removing CloudWatch dependencies.
  Tightened Effect layer wiring, refreshed tests/mocks, and aligned schemas/consumers with console-focused metadata.
  Validated Memory Bank metadata and drift checks while documenting console logging follow-ups.
- 2025-10-14 — Reconciled backend-server-cdk docs and consumers with stack outputs to prevent bootstrap artifacts.
  Confirmed lint cleanliness, noted stack consolidation opportunities, and kept memory assets formatted.
  Ensured validation scripts stayed green after doc and typing updates.
- 2025-10-15 — Centralized stack-name exports across CDK stacks, consumers, and node-server clients.
  Updated tests, mocks, and output schemas while guarding against circular imports.
  Ran targeted Vitest suites and refreshed Memory Bank formatting plus drift checks.
- 2025-10-20 — Executed lint/test remediations, repository-service workflow codification, and user repository hardening.
  Built unsafe assertion and code-quality automation scripts with aggregate runners for continuous enforcement.
  Repeatedly stamped metadata, ran lint/tests, and confirmed memory validation/drift after each initiative.
- 2025-10-21 — Enhanced repository-service workflow guidance, consolidated API security resources, and enforced AAA comments repo-wide.
  Implemented the AST-based AAA enforcement script, integrated it into `phase:check`, and kept queue helper guidance aligned.
  Ran agent finalize flows to confirm lint, quality, and memory validation stayed green across all updates.
- 2025-10-21 — Plan phase: Scoped Memory Bank pruning to keep high-signal context while preserving durable references.
  Build phase: Condensed `active.context.md` and `progress.log.md`, updated metadata, and ran `npm run phase:check`.
  Verify phase: Executed memory validation/drift, ran `npm run agent:finalize`, and logged condensed outcomes for future hygiene passes.
- 2025-10-22 — Plan phase: Scoped analytics stack resource/output renames to improve clarity across CDK consumers.
  Build phase: Renamed analytics/API construct identifiers and outputs, aligning consumer schemas/tests with the new descriptive keys.
  Verify phase: Ran `npm run phase:check` and `npm run agent:finalize` to ensure lint, quality, and memory validation stayed green.
