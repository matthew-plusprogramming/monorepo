# Software Principles

- Separation of concerns: Split responsibilities into distinct parts with clear touchpoints (like sections of an assembly line).
- Single responsibility: Each function/class/file should do one thing to improve naming, debugging, and reviewability.
- DRY: Avoid repeating logic; extract reusable functions/components.
- Composition over inheritance: Prefer composition for flexibility; use inheritance only for clear "is-a" cases.
