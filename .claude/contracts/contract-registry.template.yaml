# Contract Registry
# =================
# Cross-workstream integration boundary registry.
# Tracks all contracts between workstreams so the /investigate skill
# can surface inconsistencies before implementation begins.
#
# Schema: .claude/specs/schema/contract-registry.schema.json
# Validates as a YAML array of objects.
#
# Required fields per entry:
#   id       (string)  - Unique identifier for the contract (e.g., "ws1-ws2-user-api")
#   type     (string)  - Contract type (see common types below)
#   path     (string)  - Relative path to the contract definition file
#   owner    (string)  - Spec or workstream that owns this boundary
#   version  (integer) - Contract version, minimum 1; increment on breaking changes
#
# No additional properties are allowed (additionalProperties: false).
#
# Common contract types:
#   rest-api        - REST API endpoint contract (OpenAPI, route definition)
#   event-contract  - SSE, WebSocket, or pub/sub event shape
#   data-model      - Shared database schema or data transfer object
#   grpc            - gRPC service definition (protobuf)
#   graphql         - GraphQL schema or operation contract
#   shared-types    - Shared TypeScript interfaces or Zod schemas
#
# Example entry (uncomment and modify to use):
#
# - id: "ws1-ws2-user-api"
#   type: "rest-api"
#   path: "contracts/user-api.yaml"
#   owner: "sg-user-service"
#   version: 1

# Default: empty array (valid YAML, no contracts registered yet)
