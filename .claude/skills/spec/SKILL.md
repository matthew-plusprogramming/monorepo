# Spec Author Skill

## Required Context

Before beginning work, read these files for project-specific guidelines:

- `.claude/memory-bank/best-practices/subagent-design.md`

## Purpose

Create specifications that serve as the authoritative contract for implementation. Specs document requirements, design decisions, task breakdowns, and test plans.

**Key Output**: Creates `spec.md` in a spec group, reading from `requirements.md`.

## Usage

```
/spec <spec-group-id>           # Create spec.md from requirements.md in spec group
/spec refine <spec-group-id>    # Refine existing spec based on feedback
```

## Prerequisites

Before running `/spec`:

1. Spec group must exist at `.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/`
2. `requirements.md` must exist (from `/prd` or `/prd sync`)
3. `manifest.json` must exist with valid metadata

## Output Location

All specs are written to the spec group directory:

```
.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/
├── manifest.json      # Updated by /spec
├── requirements.md    # Input (from /prd or /prd sync)
└── spec.md           # Output (created by /spec)
```

## Spec Tiers

The complexity of the spec is determined by the requirements, but **all specs output to `spec.md`** in the spec group.

### TaskSpec (Light) - For Small to Medium Tasks

Use for:

- Single feature or enhancement
- 2-5 files impacted
- Clear scope, single workstream
- Estimated 30 min - 4 hours

**Sections**:

- Context & Goal
- Requirements Summary (references requirements.md)
- Acceptance Criteria
- Design Notes (optional)
- Task List
- Test Plan
- Decision & Work Log

### WorkstreamSpec (Full) - For Complex Single-Workstream Tasks

Use for:

- Complex feature requiring detailed design
- Multiple components or layers involved
- Needs sequence diagrams and interface definitions
- Estimated 4-8 hours
- Part of a larger effort but can be worked independently

**Sections**:

- Context
- Goals / Non-goals
- Requirements Summary (references requirements.md)
- Core Flows
- Sequence Diagrams (Mermaid)
- Edge Cases
- Interfaces & Data Model
- Security
- Additional Considerations
- Task List
- Testing
- Open Questions
- Workstream Reflection
- Decision & Work Log

### MasterSpec (Multi-workstream) - For Large Projects

Use for:

- 5+ workstreams needed
- Multiple parallel efforts
- Complex dependencies and contracts
- Requires orchestration and integration

**Approach**: Use `/orchestrate` skill which creates separate spec groups per workstream.

## Process: Spec Creation in Spec Group

### Step 1: Validate Spec Group

```
Read: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/manifest.json
Read: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/requirements.md
```

Verify:

- Spec group exists
- `requirements.md` has REQ-XXX requirements
- `manifest.json` has valid metadata

### Step 2: Read Requirements

From `requirements.md`, extract:

- Problem statement
- Goals and non-goals
- REQ-XXX requirements in EARS format
- Constraints and assumptions
- Open questions

### Step 3: Fill Context & Goal

From `requirements.md`:

- Summarize the problem and motivation
- State the clear goal and success criteria

### Step 4: Reference Requirements

**Do NOT duplicate requirements** — reference `requirements.md`:

```markdown
## Requirements Summary

See `requirements.md` for full EARS-format requirements.

| ID      | Title                 | Priority  |
| ------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| REQ-001 | User-initiated logout | Must Have |
| REQ-002 | Token clearing        | Must Have |
| REQ-003 | Post-logout redirect  | Must Have |
| REQ-004 | Error handling        | Must Have |
```

### Step 5: Define Acceptance Criteria

Map requirements to testable acceptance criteria:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1.1: Logout button clears authentication token
- AC1.2: User is redirected to login page after logout
- AC1.3: Confirmation message is displayed
- AC2.1: Network error shows error message
- AC2.2: User remains logged in on error
- AC2.3: Retry button appears on error
```

### Step 5: Add Design Notes

If non-trivial, document approach:

- Architecture decisions
- Key algorithms or data structures
- Sequence diagrams for primary flows

```markdown
## Design Notes

The logout flow will:

1. Call `/api/auth/logout` endpoint
2. Clear local storage token on success
3. Update auth context state
4. Router will redirect based on auth state change

Sequence diagram:

\`\`\`mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber
participant User
participant UI
participant AuthService
participant API
User->>UI: Click logout
UI->>AuthService: logout()
AuthService->>API: POST /api/auth/logout
API-->>AuthService: 200 OK
AuthService->>AuthService: clearToken()
AuthService-->>UI: Success
UI->>UI: Redirect to /login
UI-->>User: Show confirmation
\`\`\`
```

### Step 6: Generate Task List

Break down requirements into concrete tasks:

```markdown
## Task List

- [ ] Add logout button to UserMenu component
- [ ] Implement AuthService.logout() method
- [ ] Create /api/auth/logout endpoint
- [ ] Add error handling for network failures
- [ ] Update router to redirect on auth state change
- [ ] Add confirmation message toast
```

### Step 7: Map Test Plan

Map each acceptance criterion to test cases:

```markdown
## Test Plan

- AC1.1 → `__tests__/auth-service.test.ts`: "should clear token on logout"
- AC1.2 → `__tests__/auth-router.test.ts`: "should redirect to /login after logout"
- AC1.3 → `__tests__/user-menu.test.ts`: "should show confirmation message"
- AC2.1 → `__tests__/auth-service.test.ts`: "should show error on network failure"
- AC2.2 → `__tests__/auth-service.test.ts`: "should keep user logged in on error"
- AC2.3 → `__tests__/user-menu.test.ts`: "should show retry button on error"
```

### Step 8: Record Initial Decision

Add to Decision & Work Log:

```markdown
## Decision & Work Log

- 2026-01-14: Spec created from requirements.md
- 2026-01-14: Decision - Use toast for confirmation (consistent with existing patterns)
```

### Step 9: Write spec.md

Save to spec group:

```
.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/spec.md
```

### Step 10: Update manifest.json

Update the spec group manifest:

```json
{
  "convergence": {
    "spec_complete": true
  },
  "decision_log": [
    // ... existing entries ...
    {
      "timestamp": "<ISO timestamp>",
      "actor": "agent",
      "action": "spec_authored",
      "details": "spec.md created with X ACs, Y tasks"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 11: Report Completion

```markdown
## Spec Created ✅

**Spec Group**: <spec-group-id>
**Location**: .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/spec.md

**Summary**:

- X acceptance criteria mapped to requirements
- Y tasks identified
- Z open questions

**Next Steps**:

1. Review spec: `.claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/spec.md`

**For oneoff-spec workflow:**

2. (Optional) Run `/investigate <spec-group-id>` if cross-spec dependencies exist
3. User approves → `review_state: APPROVED`
4. Run `/implement <spec-group-id>` + `/test <spec-group-id>` (parallel)

**For orchestrator workflow:**

2. Run `/atomize <spec-group-id>` to decompose into atomic specs
3. Run `/enforce <spec-group-id>` to validate atomicity
4. User approves → `review_state: APPROVED`
5. Run `/implement <spec-group-id>` + `/test <spec-group-id>` (parallel)
```

## Process: Complex Specs (WorkstreamSpec-level detail)

For complex features requiring sequence diagrams and interface definitions:

### Additional Sections Required

Follow the template structure:

1. **Context**: Background and motivation
2. **Goals / Non-goals**: Explicit boundaries
3. **Requirements**: Atomic, testable requirements (EARS format)
4. **Core Flows**: Primary user flows and system behaviors
5. **Sequence Diagram(s)**: At least one Mermaid diagram
6. **Edge Cases**: Failure scenarios and unusual conditions
7. **Interfaces & Data Model**: Contracts, APIs, data structures
8. **Security**: Security considerations and requirements
9. **Additional Considerations**: Best practices, docs, memory bank updates
10. **Task List**: Discrete tasks with dependencies
11. **Testing**: Testing strategy and coverage
12. **Open Questions**: Unresolved questions with status
13. **Workstream Reflection**: (Fill during/after implementation)
14. **Decision & Work Log**: Decisions and approvals

### Step 3: Define Contracts

If this workstream creates interfaces used by others:

```yaml
contracts:
  - id: contract-auth-service
    type: API
    path: src/services/auth.service.ts
    version: 1.0
```

Add to contract registry in MasterSpec (if applicable).

### Step 4: Identify Dependencies

List other workstreams this depends on:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - ws-database-schema
  - ws-api-gateway
```

## Process: MasterSpec Coordination

For large multi-workstream efforts, coordinate parallel spec authoring.

### Step 1: Create ProblemBrief

Start with high-level brief:

```bash
cp .claude/templates/master-spec.template.md .claude/specs/groups/<spec-group-id>/spec.md
```

Fill Problem Brief section from /prd discovery.

### Step 2: Identify Workstreams

Decompose into parallel workstreams:

- Each workstream should be independently executable
- Minimize cross-workstream coupling
- Identify clear contracts/interfaces between workstreams

Example workstream breakdown:

```markdown
## Workstream Overview

| ID   | Title                | Owner         | Estimated Effort |
| ---- | -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| ws-1 | WebSocket Server     | spec-author-1 | 6-8h             |
| ws-2 | Frontend Client      | spec-author-2 | 4-6h             |
| ws-3 | Notification Service | spec-author-3 | 6-8h             |
```

### Step 3: Dispatch Spec-Author Subagents

Use Task tool to create workstream specs in parallel:

```javascript
// Dispatch subagent for ws-1
Task({
  description: 'Author WebSocket Server workstream spec',
  prompt: `Create a WorkstreamSpec for the WebSocket Server workstream.

Context from ProblemBrief:
<paste relevant context>

Your scope:
- WebSocket server infrastructure
- Authentication middleware
- Message routing

Contracts you provide:
- contract-websocket-api: Client connection API

Dependencies:
- ws-3 (Notification Service provides messages)

Follow the WorkstreamSpec template at .claude/templates/workstream-spec.template.md`,
  subagent_type: 'spec-author',
});
```

Dispatch one subagent per workstream.

### Step 4: Collect and Review

Review completed workstream specs:

- Check for missing sections
- Verify contracts are registered
- Confirm dependencies are valid (no cycles)

### Step 5: Merge into MasterSpec

Update MasterSpec with:

- Links to workstream specs
- Contract registry (consolidated)
- Dependency graph
- Gates & acceptance criteria

```markdown
## Contract Registry

| Contract ID               | Type | Owner Workstream | Path                          | Version |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| contract-websocket-api    | API  | ws-1             | src/websocket/server.ts       | 1.0     |
| contract-notification-api | API  | ws-3             | src/services/notifications.ts | 1.0     |

## Cross-Workstream Dependencies

```

### Step 5.5: Determine Worktree Allocation

Analyze dependency graph and workstream coupling to allocate worktrees:

**Allocation Analysis**:

1. **Identify independent workstreams**:
   - No shared files
   - No tight coupling
   - Can execute fully in parallel
   - → Assign separate worktrees

2. **Identify tightly coupled workstreams**:
   - Implementation + tests for same feature
   - Sequential modifications to same files
   - One workstream's output is immediate input to another
   - → Share worktree

3. **Consider dependency ordering**:
   - Workstreams with no dependencies can start immediately
   - Dependent workstreams blocked until prerequisites merge
   - Document merge order in allocation strategy

**Example Allocation**:

```markdown
# Analyzing 4 workstreams

ws-1: Backend API (no dependencies, independent) → worktree-1
ws-2: Frontend UI (depends on ws-1, independent from ws-3) → worktree-2
ws-3: Database schema (no dependencies, independent) → worktree-3
ws-4: Integration tests (tests ws-1, tight coupling) → worktree-1 (shared with ws-1)

**Rationale**:

- ws-1 and ws-4 share worktree: ws-4 tests ws-1 implementation (tight coupling)
- ws-2 separate: Independent frontend work, no file conflicts with backend
- ws-3 separate: Independent database work, can run in parallel

**Merge Order**:

1. ws-1 (no dependencies) + ws-4 (tests ws-1) → Merge together from worktree-1
2. ws-2 (depends on ws-1) → Blocked until ws-1 merges
3. ws-3 (no dependencies) → Can merge anytime (parallel with ws-1)
```

**Document in MasterSpec**:
Add worktree allocation strategy to MasterSpec:

```markdown
## Worktree Allocation Strategy

**Strategy**: ws-1 and ws-4 share worktree (tight coupling), ws-2 and ws-3 isolated (independent)

| Worktree ID | Branch                       | Workstreams | Rationale                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| worktree-1  | feature/ws-1-backend-api     | ws-1, ws-4  | ws-4 tests ws-1 implementation |
| worktree-2  | feature/ws-2-frontend-ui     | ws-2        | Independent frontend work      |
| worktree-3  | feature/ws-3-database-schema | ws-3        | Independent database work      |

**Merge Order**:

1. ws-1+ws-4 (no dependencies)
2. ws-3 (no dependencies) - can merge in parallel with ws-1
3. ws-2 (depends on ws-1) - blocked until ws-1 merges
```

Update Workstream Overview table with Worktree column.

### Step 6: Validate Gates

Check spec-complete gates:

- [ ] All workstream specs approved
- [ ] Contract registry complete and validated
- [ ] No unresolved cross-workstream conflicts
- [ ] Dependency graph is acyclic
- [ ] All critical open questions resolved or deferred

## Spec is Contract Principle

**Critical constraint**: Spec is the authoritative source of truth.

- Implementation must conform to spec
- Tests must verify spec requirements
- Any deviation requires spec amendment first
- Spec updates require user approval

If during implementation you discover:

- Missing requirements → Add to spec Open Questions, get approval
- Invalid assumptions → Update spec, note in Decision Log
- Better approaches → Propose spec amendment before implementing

**Never deviate silently from the spec.**

## Spec Approval Process

Before implementation begins:

1. **Present spec summary** to user
2. **Highlight key decisions** and assumptions
3. **Call out open questions** that need resolution
4. **Request approval** to proceed
5. **Record approval** in Decision & Work Log with date

Example approval request:

```markdown
## Spec Ready for Approval

I've created a TaskSpec for adding the logout button.

**Key decisions**:

- Using toast for confirmation (consistent with existing patterns)
- Network errors keep user logged in and allow retry

**Open questions**:

- Should we add keyboard shortcut (Cmd+L) for logout? (Low priority, can defer)

**Task list**: 6 tasks, estimated 2-3 hours

May I proceed with implementation?
```

## Integration with Spec Group Workflow

After spec creation:

```
/prd → requirements.md
  ↓
/spec → spec.md (YOU ARE HERE)
  ↓
  ├── [oneoff-spec workflow]
  │     ↓
  │   (optional) /investigate
  │     ↓
  │   User approves → review_state: APPROVED
  │     ↓
  │   /implement + /test (parallel)
  │
  └── [orchestrator workflow]
        ↓
      /atomize → atomic/*.md
        ↓
      /enforce → validation
        ↓
      User approves → review_state: APPROVED
        ↓
      /implement + /test (parallel, per atomic spec)
  ↓
/unify → convergence validation
  ↓
/code-review + /security
  ↓
Merge
```

### State After /spec Completes

```json
{
  "review_state": "DRAFT", // Still needs user review
  "work_state": "PLAN_READY", // Ready for approval (oneoff-spec) or atomization (orchestrator)
  "convergence": {
    "spec_complete": true // Spec authored
  }
}
```

### Handoff After /spec

After `/spec` creates `spec.md`:

**For oneoff-spec workflow:**

1. User reviews spec
2. (Optional) Run `/investigate <spec-group-id>` if cross-spec dependencies exist
3. User approves → `review_state: APPROVED`
4. Implementation begins with `/implement` + `/test`

**For orchestrator workflow:**

1. User reviews spec
2. Run `/atomize <spec-group-id>` to decompose into atomic specs
3. Run `/enforce <spec-group-id>` to validate atomicity
4. User approves → `review_state: APPROVED`
5. Implementation begins
