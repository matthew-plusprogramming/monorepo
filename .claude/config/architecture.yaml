# Architecture Configuration Template
# Defines thresholds and limits for architecture-related tooling.
# All values have sensible defaults -- this file is usable out-of-the-box.
# Customize per project as needed.

# Complexity analysis thresholds
# Used by complexity analyzers to flag components exceeding limits.
complexity:
  # Maximum allowed complexity score per component
  threshold: 15
  # Warning threshold (advisory, does not block)
  warn_at: 10

# Technical debt tracking thresholds
# Used by debt inventory tools to prioritize remediation.
debt:
  # Maximum debt score allowed per component before flagging
  threshold_per_component: 10
  # Severity weights for debt item classification
  severity_weights:
    critical: 4
    high: 3
    medium: 2
    low: 1

# Deliberation cycle limits
# Controls how many rounds of spec deliberation are allowed.
deliberation:
  # Maximum number of deliberation cycles before forcing a decision
  max_cycles: 5
  # Circuit breaker: halt deliberation after this many consecutive no-progress cycles
  circuit_breaker_limit: 3

# Atomization limits
# Controls the spec decomposition and investigation process.
atomization:
  # Maximum refinement iterations for atomic spec decomposition
  max_refinement_iterations: 3
  # Number of consecutive clean investigation passes required before approval
  investigation_clean_passes_required: 2

# Standard project paths (relative to project root)
# Override these if your project uses a non-standard directory layout.
paths:
  # Spec files directory
  specs: .claude/specs
  # Config files directory
  config: .claude/config
  # Technical debt inventory file
  debt_inventory: .claude/debt-inventory.json
