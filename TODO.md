- [x] Integrate express
- [x] Integrate db options
  - [x] Dynamo
  - [ ] Mongo
    - [ ] Maybe later?
- [x] Integration test suite to ensure configuration setup correctly
  - [x] Test behavior, not implementation. Mock only true boundaries (network, DB, clock, randomness, filesystem, process env).
  - [x] Prefer small, deterministic units + a few integration tests that exercise real wiring.
  - [x] Standardize patterns: dependency injection, test data builders, and strict AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert).
- [ ] Integrate graphql (gql.tada)
  - [ ] Maybe later?
- [ ] Redis
  - [ ] Maybe later?
